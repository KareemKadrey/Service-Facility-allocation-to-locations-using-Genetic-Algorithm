# -Service-Facility-allocation-to-locations-using-Genetic-Algorithm
Using Genetic Algorithms to optimize the allocation of services or facilities to specific locations. The primary application of this project is in the context of Covid-19 vaccine center locations, aiming to strategically position vaccination facilities for efficient and widespread coverage.
# Key Features:
<ul>
<li>Genetic Algorithm Implementation: The core of the project is built around a Genetic Algorithm, a heuristic search and optimization technique inspired by natural selection. The algorithm evolves a population of potential solutions over generations, mimicking the process of natural selection to find an optimal solution.</li>

<li>Spatial Optimization: The project considers geographical and demographic factors to optimize the allocation of service or facility centers. This is particularly relevant for Covid-19 vaccine distribution, where factors like population density, transportation networks, and healthcare infrastructure play a crucial role.</li>

<li>Scalability: The solution is designed to scale, accommodating varying sizes of regions and populations. This makes it adaptable for different scenarios, from local municipalities to entire regions or countries.</li>
</ul>
